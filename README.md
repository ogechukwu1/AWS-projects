## AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY




We are designing a secure infrastructure within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for `Zenithbyte`  Company, which runs a WordPress CMS for its primary business website and a [Tooling](https://github.com/ogechukwu1/Devops-Tooling-Website-Solution) website for the DevOps team. 

To enhance security and performance, the company has chosen to implement NGINX reverse proxy technology as part of the solution.

The key requirements for this project are to reduce costs, enhance security, and improve scalability.  Therefore, when implementing the architecture outlined below, ensure that the infrastructure for both the WordPress and Tooling websites is resilient to web server failures, capable of handling increased traffic, and remains cost-effective. 


__AWS Resources Required for the Design:__

- __Region:__ North Virginia (us-east-1)

- __Availability Zones:__ 3 subnets in us-east-1a, and 3 subnets in us-east-1b

- __VPC Network Range:__ 10.0.0.0/16

- __Subnets:__ 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24

   - 6 subnets total: 4 private subnets and 2 public subnets

- __Internet Gateway__

- __2 NGINX Servers__ for reverse proxy

- __2 Bastion Hosts/Jump Servers__

- __2 Application Load Balancers (ALB)__

- __Auto Scaling Groups__ to manage scaling of EC2 instances

- __2 NAT Gateways__ to allow resources in private subnets to communicate with the internet via the Internet Gateway.



__Note:__ The NAT gateway only permits traffic to the internet and does not allow incoming traffic from the internet.

- Route DNS

- RDS for database management

- Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for file management

__Initial setup__

- Create a dedicated sub-account in AWS to manage all resources for the company's AWS solutions, and assign an appropriate name, such as `DevOps`.

- From the root account, create an Organizational Unit (OU) `Dev` and move the sub-account into the OU. The `Dev` resources will be launched within this sub-account.

- Create a domain name for the company website using a domain name provider, where you can acquire a domain name through the [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) website.

- After that, set up a hosted zone in AWS and link the name servers from the hosted zone to the domain name.
